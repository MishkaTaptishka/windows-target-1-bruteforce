# üõ°Ô∏è Malicious Logon Activity Report ‚Äì linux-target-1

---

## üìå Executive Summary

This report documents a brute-force attack targeting the cloud-hosted Linux device `linux-target-1.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net`. Over a 30-day window, the host received **714 failed logon attempts** from IP address `218.92.0.187`, targeting the `root` account. The pattern of activity is consistent with automated SSH brute-force attempts commonly performed by low-sophistication threat actors or botnets. No successful logons were detected.

## üïµÔ∏è The 5 Ws of the Incident

### **1. Who**
- **Target System:** `linux-target-1.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net`
- **Target Account:** `root`
- **Source IP Address:** `218.92.0.187` (CHINANET Jiangsu Province Network, China)
- **Account Domain:** `linux-target-1`

---

### **2. What**
- **Event Type:** `LogonFailed`  
- **Attack Technique:** SSH brute-force password guessing  
- **Attack Tool:** Likely automated botnet agent or SSH scanner  
- **Detection Method:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (`DeviceLogonEvents`)

---

### **3. When**
- **Log Observation Period:** Last 30 days  
- **Peak Activity:** Detected within the window using Defender telemetry  
- **Log Source Table:** `DeviceLogonEvents`

---

### **4. Where**
- **Host Environment:** Azure-hosted Linux virtual machine  
- **Hostname:** `linux-target-1`  
- **DNS Context:** Internal Azure DNS naming indicates cloud deployment

---

### **5. Why**
- **Motivation:**  
  Gain unauthorized access to the `root` account using default or weak SSH credentials.
- **Intentions May Include:**  
  - Deploying malware or crypto miners  
  - Establishing persistent access  
  - Using host as a pivot for lateral movement  
  - Exfiltrating sensitive data or credentials

## üß† MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This activity maps to the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques:

### **Tactic: Initial Access**

**Technique:** [T1110.001] Brute Force: Password Guessing  
- 714 failed SSH logon attempts were recorded from IP `218.92.0.187`, directly targeting the `root` account.

---

### **Tactic: Credential Access**

**Technique:** [T1110] Brute Force  
- Although no credentials were successfully stolen, the pattern clearly matches brute-force behavior.

---

### **Tactic: Discovery (Expected if Access Gained)**

**Technique:** [T1082] System Information Discovery  
- If login were successful, attacker would likely enumerate the host environment and connected network.

---

### **Tactic: Persistence (Expected if Access Gained)**

**Technique:** [T1053.003] Scheduled Task/Job: Cron  
- Common persistence mechanism used in Linux compromises, especially via shell scripts or crypto miners.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Remediation

### üîê SSH and Credential Hardening
- Disable password-based SSH logins in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  ```text
  PermitRootLogin no
  PasswordAuthentication no
